# Getting Started English

In this course, we'll explore both the theory and practical uses of NGINX as a web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. You'll learn best practices and common scenarios, so by the end, you'll be confident in configuring NGINX for almost any situation, except for mail server use.

You'll become familiar with the NGINX documentation, which will help you troubleshoot as you go. Since NGINX is highly flexible with expandable modules, you'll also get to know some of these modules along the way.

This course is ideal for anyone already comfortable with Linux systems and looking to deepen their understanding of NGINX.
