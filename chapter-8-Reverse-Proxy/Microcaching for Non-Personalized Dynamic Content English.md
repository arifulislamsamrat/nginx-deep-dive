# Microcaching for Non-Personalized Dynamic Content English

In this video, we explore the concept of microcaching, a technique for short-term caching to enhance the performance of applications with dynamic content that doesnâ€™t need to be updated every millisecond. By using microcaching, you can significantly boost the performance of both NGINX and your application server under heavy load.

**Objective:**
Demonstrate the performance benefits of microcaching using a load testing tool called Boom and a uWSGI application.

**Setup and Testing:**

1. **Install Boom:**
    - Run `pip install boom` to install the load testing tool.
2. **Initial Load Test:**
    - Use Boom to make a request to `notes.example.com` with 30 concurrent users making 3000 requests:
        
        ```
        boom -c 30 -n 3000 <http://localhost> -H "Host:notes.example.com"
        ```
        
    - Measure the time taken and requests per second (RPS). In the example, it took 15 seconds for 3000 requests with an RPS of about 190.
3. **Configure Microcaching:**
    - Modify the NGINX configuration to set up microcaching:
        
        ```
        http {
            uwsgi_cache_path /var/cache/nginx/micro levels=1:2 keys_zone=micro:10m max_size=1g;
        }
        
        server {
            location / {
                add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
                uwsgi_cache micro;
                uwsgi_cache_key $scheme$request_method$host$request_uri;
                uwsgi_cache_valid 200 10s;
            }
        }
        ```
        
    - The cache is set to be valid for 10 seconds, meaning the same page will be served from the cache for up to 10 seconds before being refreshed.
4. **Reload NGINX:**
    - Apply the new configuration with:
        
        ```
        systemctl reload nginx
        ```
        
5. **Load Test with Microcaching:**
    - Re-run the load test using Boom:
        
        ```
        boom -c 30 -n 3000 <http://localhost> -H "Host:notes.example.com"
        ```
        
    - Observe the performance improvement. In the example, it took only 6 seconds for 3000 requests with an RPS of 446.

**Results and Analysis:**

- The initial test without microcaching took 15 seconds for 3000 requests, yielding an RPS of about 190.
- With microcaching enabled, the same number of requests completed in 6 seconds, increasing the RPS to 446.
- This significant improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of microcaching in handling higher loads and improving response times.

**Benefits of Microcaching:**

- Microcaching allows for caching dynamic content for very short periods (e.g., 10 seconds).
- It provides a substantial performance boost, especially under heavy load.
- It helps to balance the need for up-to-date content with the efficiency of serving cached responses.
- It reduces the load on the application server, allowing it to handle more requests without scaling out additional servers.

Microcaching is an effective technique for optimizing the performance of web applications with dynamic content. By caching responses for short periods, you can achieve significant performance gains, as demonstrated by the improved response times and increased RPS in the load tests. This approach is particularly useful for applications with frequent but not constant updates, allowing for efficient handling of high traffic with minimal delay in content freshness.
