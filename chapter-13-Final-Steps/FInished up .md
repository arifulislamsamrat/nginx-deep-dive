### Conclusion of the NGINX Deep Dive

You've made it to the end of the NGINX Deep Dive course. Thank you for your interest and for being an awesome member of the Linux Academy and Cloud Assessments Community.

You might have noticed that we didnâ€™t cover microservices or containerized NGINX. I want to address that before you move forward. The reason is that the main concepts you need for working with NGINX in a containerized environment are already covered in this course. To deepen your understanding of containerized software, I recommend taking some of our other courses. Specifically, the Docker Certified Associate Prep Course and the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Course will be very useful for learning how to utilize NGINX in a microservice context, as NGINX itself functions as a microservice.

Once again, thank you for participating in this course. If you found any part of it particularly useful or lacking, I hope you took the time to rate it. If not, please consider going back and doing so. Your feedback is invaluable for improving this course and future ones.

Regardless of whether you rate it, please share your thoughts and experiences in the community. Thank you again, and good luck with your continued learning!
