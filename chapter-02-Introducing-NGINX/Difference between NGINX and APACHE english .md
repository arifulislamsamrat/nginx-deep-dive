# Difference between NGINX and APACHE english

- **Common Question**: Which web server to use, NGINX or Apache?
- **Apache**: Long-standing, widely used on high-profile sites.
- **NGINX**: Newer, optimized for handling many concurrent requests.

### Configuration

- **NGINX**:
    - Custom configuration language, directive-based.
    - Keywords with arguments, similar to functions.
    - Uses squiggly braces to separate configuration blocks.
- **Apache**:
    - Also uses a directive-based language.
    - Configuration blocks resemble XML tags.
    - Slightly different syntax compared to NGINX, but overall similar in structure.

### Processing Methods

- **NGINX**:
    - Designed to handle many concurrent requests.
    - Uses a worker process model with threads triggered by events.
    - Asynchronous processing enhances concurrent performance.
- **Apache**:
    - Offers multiple processing methods:
        - **Prefork**: Original method.
        - **Worker**: Uses separate processes and threads.
        - **Event**: Similar to worker but optimized for keepalive connections.

### Extensibility

- **NGINX** and **Apache**:
    - Both can be extended with third-party modules.
    - Modules can be dynamic, meaning no need to recompile the server to use them.
    - Apache has had dynamic modules for a long time; they are a recent addition to NGINX.

### Performance: Static vs. Dynamic Content

- **Static Content**:
    - **NGINX**: Highly performant in serving static files, making it an excellent caching server.
    - **Apache**: Slower than NGINX when serving static content.
- **Dynamic Content**:
    - Both servers offer similar performance when handling dynamic content or acting as reverse proxies.

### .htaccess File

- **NGINX**:
    - Does not support .htaccess files.
    - Configuration is managed globally rather than on a per-directory basis.
- **Apache**:
    - Supports .htaccess files for sub-directory specific configuration.

### Performance and Resource Usage

- **NGINX**:
    - More efficient on lower-end hardware due to lightweight nature.
    - Requires fewer resources.
    - Superior hardware utilization.

- **Similarities**:
    - Both are web servers with overlapping functionalities.
    - Capable of acting as load balancers and reverse proxies.
- **Differences**:
    - Configuration syntax and processing models are the main differentiators.
    - NGINX is generally preferred for its performance, especially with static content and on low-end hardware.
    - NGINXâ€™s configuration language is considered easier to read and manage.

Both NGINX and Apache are robust web servers with their own strengths, making the choice dependent on specific use cases and performance needs.
